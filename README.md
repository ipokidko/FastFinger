# FastFinger by 256devs
Small project for study some things

In this project we used a few technologies for work with UI, namely:
DialogFragment for creating pop-up dialog window;
ShapeDrawable for styling UI elements;
OnTouchListener and OnClickListener for callback some View elements.
And for work with data:
CountDownTimer for Schedule a countdown until a time in the future;
Random we used to generate a stream of pseudorandom numbers;
SharedPreferences Interface for accessing, modifying and saving data.
